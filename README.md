Optimizing Horiseon Website for Accessability.

My goal was to optimize Horiseon's website so that it is accessable to users with slow internet connections, low bandwith, or those who use screen readers.

Changes:

Img Alt Text: I added alt text for the main photos for accessability for screen readers etc. I omitted alt text on icons to avoid redundancy.

Headings: Heading semantics altered so that they follow a logical order (i.e H1-H6)

Semantic Tags: Changed tag semantics to allow easier navigation

Css: Altered css to retain look of website with new changes

Title: Added descriptive title.
